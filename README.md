- ‚òÄÔ∏è By day at the University of Southampton, I explore how to understand and explain the decision making of reinforcement learning agent, in particular, the goals and future aims of an agent. This work is completed within the MINDS CDT with a sponsorship from the Royal Bank of Canada.

This is as I am member of the [Farama Foundation](https://farama.org/team), you can read more about it [here](https://farama.org/Announcing-The-Farama-Foundation)
